This project aims to use blockchain methods to decentralize voting. I was very interested in blockchain, crypto, and what is really was. I heard so much about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies before I started studying data science. One day, it dawned on me that with my experience in coding, I could acutally understand what was happening, and make my own. The project is primarily an excercise to learn about blockchain technology, and it was very successful in that respect.
