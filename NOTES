Types of blockchains:
    -Public Blockchain:
        - Permission-less, open, completely decentralized
        - All nodes verify data
        - Incentives to verifying data/mining blocks
        - Shared/transparent ledger
        - Secure with 51% rule
            -???
        - Hidden user identity
        - No regulations
        - No way to track transactions
            -???
    -Hybrid Blockchain:
        - Certain parts of the chain are public, and some are private
        - Customizable level of security, decentralization
        - Balances transparency and decentralization
    -Private Blockchain:
        - Restricts access to only certain users
        - Operate on closed network
        - Permissions managed by an organization
            - Not completely decentralized
        - Used for supply-chain management,
        asset ownership verification, and internal voting systems
        - Organizations have more control over their data, less centralized though
        - These are typically faster than public blockchains
    - Federated/Consortium Blockchain:
        - A consortium/group of nodes/organizations work together to confirm nodes
        - These are permissioned, like private blockchains
        - These are useful when a group of organizations need to share and confirm data
            - Probably useful for sharing of data between hospitals
        - Tend to be faster than public chains, but less decentralization
Layers of a Blockchain:
    - Hardware/Infrastructure Layer:
        -
    - Data Layer:
        - Chain structure:
            - The actual data structure of the chain is a linked list of blocks.
            - Each block has a pointer to the hash of the block before it, and its transaction data
            - The pointer maintains the order of the chain. Refers to location of other variables
        - Block Structure:
            - Determined in the data layer
            - Merkle Tree:
                - Tree of binary hashes that ensures integrity, security, and immutability
                - It holds info like:
                    - Previous block has
                    - Datetime
                    - Nonce
                        - This is the number that makes the hash start with 30 zeros
                    - Block version number
                    - Current Difficulty Goal
        - Digital Signature:
            - Each transaction in the block must be digitally signed by the person who made it
            to provide authentication and integrity
            - Anyone with corresponding public key can verify the authenticity of a transaction
                - ???
    - Network Layer:
        - Sometimes called the P2P layer.
            - In p2p networks, all the nodes cooperate towards a certain goal. In this context,
            they are trying to maintain validity of blockchain state
        - Facilitates communication between nodes on the network
        - Enables:
            - Transactions
            - Block Propagation
                - ???
            - Discovery of blocks in the network
            - Effective communication between nodes
            - Synchronization
            - Information propagation
        - This layer focuses on maintaining the validity of the blockchains state
        - Node Types:
            - Full
                - These are responsible for mining, enforcing consensus rules, and validation
            - Light
                - Store blockchain headers, create/send transactions
    - Consensus Layer:
        - This layer orders, validates blocks, and facilitates agreement among nodes
        - This establishes the rules/laws/conditions for agreement, integrity, and security
        - Ensures there is no manipulation by ensuring agreement
         on validity and order of transactions
        - Enables collective decision making by all network participants
    - Application/Presentation Layer:
        - User interface
        - Includes execution, smart contracts, scripts, and frameworks
            - ???
        - Communicate with the blockchain network through wallets, browsers, NFTs, or social media
        - They communicate with an API
            - The backend/database is the previous 4 layers.
            - The api/frontend is this layer.
        - Semantic layer:
            - Contained within the application layer
            - Where transaction validation and execution happens, which ensures integrity
             and accuracy of transaction
        - Users access and manage data within this application.
            - This is where doctors could enter diagnosis/data.
-Components of a blockchain:
    - Block:
        - Contains the most recent, unconfirmed transactions
        - Once the block is confirmed by the network, it is immutable
        #### BLOCK STRUCTURE ####
            - Header:
                - Previous Block Hash
                - Nonce
                - Merkle Tree Root Hash
                - Difficulty Target
                - Timestamp
            - Body:
                - Transactions
            - Current Block Hash
    - Ledger:
        - The collection of immutable data stored in the block chain
        - Permissionless:
            - Every node has a copy that is updated live
        - Permissionless:
            - Authorized nodes have copy that is updated live
    - Transparency:
        - Every node of the network should be able to view and verify transactions
        - That would include sender, receiver, amount, and all other transaction data
    #### Confirmation ####
        - Uses consensus algorithms to confirm transactions/blocks
            - Proof of Work Consensus:
                - This is where miners iteratively hash blocks with modulated nonces
                    - Once a nonce that satisfies a condition (like hash starts with 30 zeros),
                    the block is confirmed and added to the chain.
                    - Hashing blocks takes as much computing power as needed to ensure that
                    a block is created every X minutes. The amount of zeros that a block must
                    start with is the parameter that changes how hard the blocks are to mine. This
                    is called block discovery rate.
                    - Mining is very expensive, computationally, monetarily, and environmentally.
                    It is incentivized by offering rewards to successful block miners.
                    - There are also transaction fees that are awarded to the successful miner.
    #### TRANSACTIONS/UTXO ####
        - Fundamental transfer of data:
            - Sender address
            - Recipient address
            - Amount
            - Date
            - Transaction fee
            - More
        - UTXO:
            - Stands for Unspent Transaction Output
            - 1 or more UTXOs are created with each transaction, and they represent unspent outputs
            associated with a specific transaction, and specific address.
            - Each UTXO is associated with 1 and only 1 address, and can only be spent by that address
            -
